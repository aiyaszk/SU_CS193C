AI provided a small amount of assistance in debugging

I only used AI in this case.
My initial thought on this function was 

window.setTimeout = (
        () => {
            document.getElementById("textField").style.backgroundColor = "red";
            document.getElementById("warning").style.display = "inline";
        }
        ,3000);

which was not working, AI pointed out the equal sign that shouldn't be there.
