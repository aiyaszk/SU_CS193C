AI provided a small amount of assistance in debugging

I only used AI because for some reason my clear.png was not getting detected the source of the image. 
My AI prompt
""
if(acard.src=='clear.png') {
        console.log("notclear");
        return "notclear";
    }

is not working why

when i write it like this

if(acard.src=='file:///Users/alyakurt/Desktop/cs193c/assignments/assign3/matching/clear.png') {
        console.log("notclear");
    }

it works but i don't want this

Use Relative File Path:
Instead of the full file path, use the relative file path to 'clear.png' in your code. This way, the code will work as long as the image is in the same directory as the HTML file or in a subdirectory relative to the HTML file.
For example, if the 'clear.png' image is in the same directory as your HTML file, you can do:

javascript
Copy code
if (acard.src.includes('clear.png')) { //I used this
    console.log("notclear");
}
Check the Image Filename:
If the image filename is always 'clear.png', you can check the last part of the src attribute, which should contain the image filename.
javascript
Copy code
if (acard.src.endsWith('clear.png')) {
    console.log("notclear");
}
Using either of these methods will make your code more flexible and independent of the absolute file path, and it will work even if the project is moved to a different location or server.
