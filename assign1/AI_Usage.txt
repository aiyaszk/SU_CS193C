Asked AI general questions about concepts related to the assignment. But
did not ask about the assignment itself (e.g., asked AI about how grid-based
CSS layout works, but did not ask it to generate code specific to the
assignment).

I only used chatgpt for how to utilize this function.
    tr:nth-child(even) {
        background-color: #EEE;
    }
I was not sure how to utilize it. Therefore I asked to write it with even lines.

I used w3schools website to learn new concepts except for the specific function above.
