    <p>
        I’m a highschool student who adores every aspect of computers! <br> <br>

        My name is Alya. I'm from Turkey and I just finished 10th grade. 
        I study at American Robert College School in İstanbul and will gruaduate on 2025. <br> <br>
        I'm especially interested in VR, AR, Game development along with parts of AI. <br>
        I'm currently learning about the computer hardware and WPILIB library for my first FRC year, 
        studying Flutter and exploring some front end languages here at <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> CS193C. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I also am a huge animation and 3D design geek so I love working on Occulus Quest 2 games as well :) <br>
        I started side loading and making my XR projects in Unity last summer. 
        Hope to improve myself more on this topic! <br>
        If you are also exploring this field at <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> I would love to have a chat with you. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently I’m looking to collaborate on Game Jams too. <br>
        I can use Unity Engine, Sandbox Game Maker and GameMaker Studio 2. <br>
        I also am an amateur artist that can draw sprites via Aseprite or create 3D models on Zbrush. 
        Moreover, if there is any narrative needed for games I use Procreate to draw digitally. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        A bit more on VR and AR :) <br>
        I recently completed a four-week internship at Koç University's Optical Microsystems Laboratory, where I successfully developed an ARienteering application for the school using Unity. <br> <br>
        In addition, I possess proficiency in utilizing ZBrush and Blender to create customized 3D models. <br>
        I also own an Oculus 2 set, through which I have gained practical experience with the Unity XR interaction toolkit, following the materials of Tevfik Ufuk Demirbaş. <br>
        Furthermore, I have collaborated with my school on community involvement projects aimed at educating others about the Metaverse and VR. <br>
